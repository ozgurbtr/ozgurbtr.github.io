[AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) is a private docker registry provided by
 Amazon. It is a good alternative to host your own repo server with
 [Docker Registry](https://github.com/docker/distribution), or using
 [the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) similar services especially if you
 use AWS as your deployment environment.
